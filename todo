general:
- on ctrl-c or any other kind of exit
    - output should be informed to potentially send empty status?
    - eg, dwm sticks with the last datetime
x make sure exceptions show up in a log file, thru the threading and queues
    x notify works
    - add logging to a file, notify in status with "check ~/.log-ltstatus" or so
    - make sure stdout is clean and only stderr contains noise
- notify user if something hasnt updated in a long time, or mark somehow for now
- debug version output to understand what updated, and why a new line has been printed
    - with color output to indicate?
- time to setup all those things, especially with vim: pylint, black, isort, configs each of, venv handling
x dwm version uses much cpu!? also dbus heavy
    - i also still see more updates than I would think with dwm setting, make that debug view after all to understand who is aggressive
        - probably some of the still-lazy callback implementations
- add commit hook, for format at least, maybe also for pylint
    - make it happen in setup?
- maybe do make a send update thing that remembers the last content, so that not everybody duplicates that logic
    - this prevents from sending same state
    - but still every monitor should make an effort to not even try to send an update often
- why .xsession log file for status is empty?
- dbus
    o would be nice to handle it a bit more readable
    x I think netflix or other mediaplayer stuff might send "playing" and then the spotify monitor is confused
- have cpu calm monitor also show disk bandwidth in similar manner?
o calm
    - or a "graph like"? to see past, well that's maybe the linuxy (0.4, 0.8, 0.1)?
    - histogram with braille more compact? or with numbers? also rescale to highest probably?
- is readthedocs a good idea? or stick with small readme
    - also make the readme templated to quicker produce the images
    - make it into pypy so people can install pip install ltstatus?
- sometimes nvidia can fail after resume or so, if it failed, we should just retry the context, should work, others maybe the same
